Introduction to various Application Programming Interfaces (API) available
for dynamic query of our services.

OAI-PMH
=======

From the `OAI-PMH <https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/>`_ home page:

    The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
    is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers are
    repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. Service Providers then
    make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata. OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs
    or services that are invoked within HTTP.

For more information see `<https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/>`_.

OpenSearch
==========

From the `OpenSearch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch>`_ Wikipedia
entry:

    OpenSearch is a collection of technologies that allow publishing of search
    results in a format suitable for syndication and aggregation. It is a way
    for websites and search engines to publish search results in a standard and
    accessible format.

For more information see the `OpenSearch specification
<https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch>`_.

DSpace REST API
===============

DSpace REST API, first introduced in DSpace version 7. For more information see
`DSpace 7 REST API <https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+7+REST+API>`_.

OpenAPI Specification
=====================

The `OpenAPI Specification <https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html>`_ (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.
