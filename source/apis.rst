Introduction to various Application Programming Interfaces (API) available
for dynamic query of our services.

OAI-PMH
-------

From the `OAI-PMH <https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/>`_ home page:

    The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
    is a low-barrier mechanism for repository interoperability. Data Providers are
    repositories that expose structured metadata via OAI-PMH. Service Providers then
    make OAI-PMH service requests to harvest that metadata. OAI-PMH is a set of six verbs
    or services that are invoked within HTTP.

    for websites and search engines to publish search results in a standard and
    accessible format.
