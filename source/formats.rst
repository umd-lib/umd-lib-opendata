Bagit
-----

From the Wikipedia `BagIt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt>`_ entry:

    BagIt is a set of hierarchical file system conventions designed to support
    disk-based storage and network transfer of arbitrary digital content. A
    "bag" consists of a "payload" (the arbitrary content) and "tags", which are
    metadata files intended to document the storage and transfer of the bag. A
    required tag file contains a manifest listing every file in the payload
    together with its corresponding checksum. The name, BagIt, is inspired by
    the "enclose and deposit" method,[1] sometimes referred to as "bag it and
    tag it".

The full specification is available in `RFC 8493
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493>`_.
